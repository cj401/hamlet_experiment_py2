Instruction:
The parameters and where to save the output file can be changed in latent_continue_syn.config. 
To generate data is to run latent_continue_syn.py in the terminal by
‘python latent_continue_syn.py con_fig_file_name(latent_continue_syn.config) 
output_directory_name(e.g. block_diag12)’

[Parameter explanation]
number_of_group: 
number of clusters in the model

number_state_in_group: 
the number of states in each cluster, in this generating process, the number of states is the same among different clusters

trans_prob_in_group:
the transition probability for a state to go to other states (including itself) in the same group (cluster)

time_step:
number of observation (number of transition)

data_dimension:
the dimension of the data

mean_sd:
In this generating process, the mean by state is generated by a N(0, mean_sd), and the diagonal of the precision matrix is generated by Gamma(1,1)

gamma_constant:
When generating the transition matrix, I do not want the state in the same group shared the same transition probability, so I use several gamma distribution and then normalize them to get the proportion. A larger gamma constant will result in a more even transition probability (e.g. 0.26 0.24 0.25 0.25 proportion share instead of 0.1 0.4 0.3 0.2).

[output explanation]
save_path:
The directory that the output is saved under. As we discussed before, the output will be saved as ‘latent_continue_syn’ directory under ‘hamlet/experiment/data’, and the program will be run in directory ‘hamlet/experiment’, so the default save_path I included in the config file is ‘data’.
